    <h1>Hello World,</h1>
    <div id="textBox1">
        <p>If you couldnt guess by now, my name is sage, and it's a pleasure to meet ya. I am currently a student at General Assembly, studying software engineering. My path into engineering has been a long one.. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="textBox2">
        <h2>Here's the short and sweet version</h2>
        <p>I never was into traditonal college, and socital expectations where that I should just suffer through it to get a job.. </p>
        <p>So I studied philosophy for years but never understood the structure and hated how education was not about learning but making money...</p>
        <p>Eventually I left [thanks, but no thanks, pandemic] and jumped around in different career paths..</p>
        <p>I started a writing buisness, tried to go to massage school and even considered just cutting my losses and going back to university...</p>
        <p>Then a gut feeling told me to try coding again (I had tried it in highschool, but didn't prusue it) and I instantly felt the passion. </p>
        <p>I fell in love with making things work through code, and the science of it all!</p> 
        <h4>Here are some of the things that I value (work and just in life)</h4>
        <ul id="values"> 
            <li>Honesty</li>
            <li>Growth Mindsets</li>
            <li>Connectedness</li>
            <li>Genuine Fun</li>
            <li>Compassion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outside of work you'll find me hiking, rock-climbing, traveling somewhere new, or deep in a philosophy book questioning life</p>
